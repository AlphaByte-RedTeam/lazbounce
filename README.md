## How to write a good commit message?
Use this conventional commit message everytime you made changes. <br>

## Semantic Commit Messages
`initial commit` -> Do this at the beginning of the project. <br>

Format: `<type>(scope): <subject>`
`<scope>` is *optional*.
```
eat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.

+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

## Type of Commit
- `feat:` The new feature you're adding to a particular application

- `style:` Feature and updates related to styling
- `refactor:` Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
- `test:` Everything related to testing
- `docs:` Changes to the documentation
- `chore:` Regular code maintenance. *You can also use emojis to represent commit types*

## Tips for Creating a Great Commit
1. Specify the type of commit
2. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
3. Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
4. Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
5. Do not end the subject line with a period
6. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
7. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
8. Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them
9. Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it
10. Do not think your code is self-explanatory
11. Follow the commit convention defined by your team
